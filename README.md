# Recommendation-Systems
Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer "relevant" suggestions to users.  

MovieLens 100K dataset has been a standard dataset used for benchmarking recommender systems for more than 20 years now and hence this provides a good point to start our learning journey for recommender systems.
The data was collected through the MovieLens web site (movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users who had less than 20 ratings or did not have complete demographic information were removed from this data set. 

In this project , I am using ##Movielens - 100K Dataset and Sérendipité dataset 
 to explore various categories of Recommender Systems like

 
1. Non Personalised Recommender Systems
2. User Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Item Based Collaborative Filtering
4. Matrix Factorization Based Collaborative Filtering
