# Recommendation-Systems
Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer "relevant" suggestions to users.  

In this project , I am using ##Movielens - 100K Dataset and Sérendipité dataset 
 to explore various categories of Recommender Systems like
 
1. Non Personalised Recommender Systems
2. User Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Item Based Collaborative Filtering
4. Matrix Factorization Based Collaborative Filtering
